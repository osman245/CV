Offer a range of pre-defined Helm templates for common Kubernetes applications like web servers, databases, and more.
Custom Configuration: Allow users to specify configurations, such as resources (CPU, Memory), environment variables, and
Auto-generate README.md files with clear instructions on how to deploy the Helm chart, prerequisites, and configuration
options.
Before generating the Helm project, validate user inputs to ensure that they meet certain Kubernetes best practices.
